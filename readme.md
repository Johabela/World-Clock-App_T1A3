**World Work Application**

 People struggle to organise catch-ups/ video calls online with family/ friends/ work based in other parts of the world. I personally do that's why I am creating this application called  World Clock App and it will have the following: 


**1st Feature - Menu**: 
               Selection of the two options for users to select within the app. 
               I will use a while loop for users be able to select the two options (current & desirable time zone)
               

**2nd Feature** - Current time zone 
                There is a database called pytz in Python. I will use it to bring the time zones. 
                I will create a list where I can store some cities/countries, then users will type their city and they will need to type the country they want to see the time, and then the two cities will come up with their current time zone. 


**3rd Feature** - Desirable time zone
                Desirable/specific time zone from two cities/country in the future 
                Users will be able to enter the time they will like to predict
                I will be using the related tools to calculate the time difference (RESEARCH)
